# TopasAvogadroZmatrixConverter
Script to convert Gaussian ZMatrix to Topas format ZMatrix. This way u can create rigid bodies in Avogadro, save it as Gaussian ZMatrix and then load it into Topas.

# Instructions
To use the script simply run the .py file.  
You just need to change the **path** to the gzmat file and the **start_matrix** variable from the .py file.  
- **start_matrix**:the line number in which first atom is written
- **path**, the file path

.pynb file (Jupyter Notebook) provides a step-by-step conversion tutorial.
